          <summary>Why is my Windows PC running slow?</summary>
          <p>A sluggish PC can be a major headache. Here are some possible culprits:</p>
          <h3>Hardware Hurdles:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Dust Bunnies:</span> Over time, dust buildup can clog fans and vents, causing your PC to overheat and throttle performance. A quick cleaning might do the trick!</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Aging Hardware:</span> If your PC is getting on in years, its components might not be able to keep up with newer software demands. Consider upgrading your RAM, storage, or even the processor if it's really old.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Software Snags:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Startup Overload:</span> Too many programs launching at startup can gobble up resources before you even start your day. Check your startup settings and disable unnecessary programs.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Background Hogs:</span> Apps running in the background (even when you're not actively using them) can drain your PC's power. Review your running processes and close any you don't need.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Disk Space Diet:</span> A full or nearly full hard drive can leave your PC feeling cramped and slow. Free up space by deleting unused files, programs, or temporary data.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Fragmentation Frustration:</span>  If you have a traditional hard disk drive (HDD), fragmented files can slow things down. Defragmenting your HDD can help (but skip this step if you have a solid-state drive – SSD).</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Malware Mayhem:</span> Malicious software can wreak havoc on your system's performance. Run a full scan with your antivirus software to root out any troublemakers.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Driver Dilemmas:</span> Outdated or incompatible drivers can cause conflicts and slowdowns. Make sure all your drivers are up-to-date, especially for your graphics card and network adapter.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Win32PrioritySeparation Woes:</span>This Windows setting can sometimes impact performance, especially on older or less powerful PCs. Experiment with adjusting it (but be careful, as incorrect changes can cause instability).</li>
